Below are the commands and their explanations that you'll encounter while using subatomic:

### onboard me
The most important command, without onboarding yourself you will not be able to run any subatomic commands.

You will be asked to input your `first name`, `last name`, `email address` and `domain username`.
Once submitted you will be able to execute subatomic commands granted you have the permission to execute them.

For a detailed walk through click [here](../user-guide/onboarding.md)

### create team
You will need to input two values `team name` and `team description`. This will create a team with
the respective values in Subatomic.

### apply to team

### create team channel
This will create a public slack channel, if you want a private channel you will need to create
it manually then proceed to [sub link team channel](./command-reference-index.md#link-team-channel).

### link team channel
If you already have an existing slack channel use this command. Subatomic will add the atomist bot
to this channel, however if the channel is private you will need to manually invite the bot.

### request devops environment

### create project

### add config server
