Below are the commands and their explanations that you'll encounter while using subatomic:

### **onboard me**
The most important command, without onboarding yourself you will not be able to run any subatomic commands.

You will need to input your `first name`, `last name`, `email address` and `domain username`.
Once submitted you will be able to execute subatomic commands granted you have the permission to execute them.

### **create team**
You will need to input two values `team name` and `team description`. This will create a team with
the respective values in Subatomic.

### **apply to team**
This will send a request to the channel that you type in. Once accepted you will be within said channel.

### **create team channel**
This will create a public slack channel, if you want a private channel you will need to create
it manually then proceed to [sub link team channel](./command-reference.md#link-team-channel).

### **link team channel**
If you already have an existing slack channel use this command. Subatomic will add the atomist bot
to this channel, however if the channel is private you will need to manually invite the bot.

### **request devops environment**

### **request project environments**

### **create project**
You will need to input two values `project name` and `project description`. This will create a project within
Subatomic.

### **create bitbucket project**

Subatomic project.

### **link bitbucket project**
You will need to input your `bitbucket project key` and Subatomic will find the existing project within Bitbucket.
