# Create a Project
At this point in the guide you should have been presented with a prompt to create a new project. You should have arrived at this point through the conversational prompts presented after creating your team and associated a slack channel to it. Note that project creation can also be invoked through the command run in your team channel as below

`@atomist sub create project`

> For details on the use of this command please see [here](../quantum-mechanic/command-reference.md#create-project)

When talking to the Atomist bot in a channel, conversational prompts will occur in a thread. Follow the prompts and enter the necessary values for you project. An example of this is seen below

![Project Creation](/images/user-guide/create-a-project/create-a-project.png =100x)

Re-assign the values if necessary and submit when ready. You should then be presented with options to link or create a Bitbucket project to associate to the Subatomic project, and an option to create the necessary OpenShift environments. 

![Post Project Creation](/images/user-guide/create-a-project/post-project-creation.png)

Choose the option to link an existing Bitbucket project.
