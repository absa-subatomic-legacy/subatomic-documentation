# **User Onboarding**
Before doing anything on Subatomic, a user needs to be onboarded onto the system to provide context for any commands issued to Quantum Mechanic. To begin the onboarding process open a direct message slack conversation the the Atomist bot.  the following command

`sub onboard me`
> For details on the use of this command please see [here](../quantum-mechanic/command-reference.md#member-commands)

A conversation guiding you through the requirements for onboarding your user is started. Follow the prompts and enter the details requested. Below is an example of onboarding

At this point you are presented with an overview of the values you have entered. If you are happy with what you have entered either click the "Submit" button or respond with `submit` to proceed.
 
 If you wish to change a value respond with `set [parameter] [value]`. E.g. to change the first name of the user respond with `set firstName My New First Name` and then submit at the next prompt to do so. Please note that this process of submission/reassignment can be followed for all commands in subatomic.

After submitting you will be presented with a prompt about joining or creating a team as seen below
