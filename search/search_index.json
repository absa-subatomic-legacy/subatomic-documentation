Getting Started There are many moving pieces in the Subatomic environment but a users main interaction with the system will occur through the Quantum Mechanic slack client. In future a web ui will be added for a more powerful user experience. Below are some links to help a user getting started with the system.

The Subatomic Stack Subatomic is built with a specific core stack in mind. The below list details the environment requirements for running Subatomic. Openshift - \"Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift is a container application platform that brings docker and Kubernetes to the enterprise\". Openshift is used to provision environments for new projects and as a home for the associated CI/CD pipelines created through subatomic. Bitbucket Server - Subatomic's primary market is large development teams and naturally this tends towards large organizational environments. The Atlassian stack is common place in such environments and as such Bitbucket Server is currently the only supported source control system supported in Subatomic.

General These are questions that apply in general to Subatomic use. What is the difference between an application and a library? An application in Subatomic means a code base that is deployable and can be run by itself. An example would be a spring boot application, or an angular application. When linking or creating an application, all associated OpenShift resources required to deploy the application will be created along with the Jenkins build. This includes the necessary DeploymentConfig's and a BuildConfig for the application. A library on the other hand is code that is meant to be used by other codebases. An example of such would be a library of math functions that are reused by various applications. When linking or creating a library, only the Jenkins build is created. The user is expected to push the artifact from their Jenkins build into a reusable location such as Nexus for use in other applications. Common Jenkins buid failures Error: Jenkins fails to pull maven dependencies. This could possibly be happening due to a mvnw file in your repo. Currently mvn wrappers are not a supported in the default jenkins build pipeline provided by Subatomic. Error: Could not determine exact tip revision. This is bug in the current version of Jenkins used. The solution involves rescanning your multibranch pipeline in Jenkins, or performing a new code commit. No commands work or I get permission errors when running commands Possibility 1: Commands are not running because the automation client or the Gluon backend is not accessible. You will need to contact your Subatomic administrator. Possibility 2: Commands in a particular team channel are failing because you are either not actually a member of the team, or you dont have the permissions to run an owner specific command. To view the list of team members and owners for a team run @atomist sub list team members . Commands Any questions related to running particular commands can be found in this section. sub onboard me Error: Failed to onboard since the member's details are already in use. When onboarding a user, it is important to have a unique username, email, and slack user. If any of these are already in use, the user needs to use different details to onboard. It is also likely that the user has already onboarded themselves and can try continue assuming that they are before trying different credentials. sub link bitbucket project Question: How do I find my Bitbucket project key? Your Bitbucket project key can be obtained from the URL to your Bitbucket project. The Bitbucket URL to your project should look similar to the following: https://bitbucket.organisation.com/projects/PROJECT_KEY/repos/browse .
